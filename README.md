UX/UI Developer Take-Home Coding Challenge

### Objectives:

Your task is to build a simple and responsive sign-in page using the Figma prototype linked below. This is meant to test your coding skills using the 3 pillars of frontend development - HTML, CSS, and JS. There is no time limit but depending on your skill level this should take around 3-6 hours to complete.

#### Figma Prototype:

[https://www.figma.com/proto/CRlMOCD3gsF01VEyK1kraT/UX%2FUI-Take-Home?node-id=3%3A4&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A4](https://www.figma.com/proto/CRlMOCD3gsF01VEyK1kraT/UX%2FUI-Take-Home?node-id=3%3A4&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A4)

### What we're looking for?

The completed pages should very closely resemble the prototype's design and should have the functionalities listed below.

- Simple form validation, both email and password is required in order for the form to be submitted.
  - Form validation upon submission (required)
  - Inline form validation (not required)
- Show/hide password functionality

Note: the red text on each page is not part of the UI (don't include it on the page you build), it's there to provide more info and a way to go back to the start page

### Instructions:

1. Fork or [download](https://github.com/xtianares/UX-coding-challenge/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repo, everything you need is in this repo including the assets used in the mockup.
2. Using the included starter files, build the sign-in pages.
3. Have fun with it, you can add additional features if you like.
4. When you're done, commit your changes to your own github repo and send us a link.
5. You can also send us a .zip file of the project if you can't create your own github repo.
